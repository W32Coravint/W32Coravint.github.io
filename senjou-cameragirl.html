<hr />
<br/>
The train carried onward, ascending towards the surface of Prospit with a collection of evacuees, dreamers, anime girls and nameless entities aboard.
<p>
Shiragiku sat in the carriage of the train &mdash; well, it would be more of a train and less of an elevator if it actually moved lengthwise, but that&rsquo;s not really part of the point &mdash; with her phone in her hands, though she wasn&rsquo;t really looking at it; she was merely keeping it there to give the impression that she wasn&rsquo;t lost in thought. The upcoming entity battle would be tough, and she was most definitely going to need what little rest she could give her processors. Derse-chan sat next to her, half asleep. Soon enough, she reckoned, the battle would begin &mdash; if it didn&rsquo;t come to her outright.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;Gaaaah...&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
Shiragiku looked around the carriage. The train had twelve carriages, and all of its seats were filled; the occasional standing carapacian with their gaze fixed to their smartphone or book interrupted Shiragiku&rsquo;s line of sight as she looked to the side, towards the end of the train.
</p>

<p>
She felt Derse-chan&rsquo;s hair brush against her skin, and soon enough the anime girl&rsquo;s head was resting against her shoulder, her body slumped over. She decided to let her rest for now &mdash; she&rsquo;d need to be as well rested as she possibly could if she wanted to be at her peak performance later.
</p>

<p>
The train was an express service for the surface; the Queen herself had commanded this particular service to run from the core, stopping at the palace and a few more stations along the way, and end at the northernmost station on the surface. Even so, it took about ten minutes; while some of the others had chosen to take their fancy teleportation sticks and portal generators, Shiragiku decided to take the slow &mdash; albeit not scenic &mdash; route. The magician she&rsquo;d been accompanied by had taken a portal; though he&rsquo;d agreed to wait at the station for her.
</p>

<p>
Derse-chan suddenly sat up, looking around in a panic, her eyes darting from left to right. <span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;A-ah!&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;What happened, D&mdash; er, <em>Kurante</em>?&rdquo; </span> Shiragiku asked, catching herself before she could make the mistake of speaking the girl&rsquo;s real name in the presence of those who could, just possibly, see her as enemies.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;N-nothing. I just... felt like I was falling.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
Shiragiku sighed. <span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;Must be the Heartless. Do they cause nightmares?&rdquo; </span> she asked, not expecting Derse-chan &mdash; or anyone else &mdash; to know the answer. 
</p>

<p>
Derse-chan played with a strand of her dark green hair &mdash; it wasn&rsquo;t a wig; she&rsquo;d used a sort of magical dye to dye it the dark olive green color it was now &mdash; and tried her best to seem composed. She absent-mindedly reached for her camera; besides being UU-polymorphic to the staff Shiragiku had granted her when she first manifested, it was fully functional and kept its memory between transformations. She lined up a shot of the train&rsquo;s interior on a whim. Several carapacians stared at her for a moment and one of them gave her a distinct glare; she turned the camera to the side and quickly snapped a photo of the doors, with a young-looking Prospit dreamer standing by the side of one of them.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a feeling I&rsquo;m a pretty good photographer,&rdquo; </span> she remarked, grinning and showing Shiragiku her reel. Three shots of the interior of the Royal Palace, each decently structured considering the chaos that was going on in the palace at the time. A shot of herself and Prospit-chan, taken in secret while the two met. Several shots of the metro station serving the exterior of the palace, with a few flubbed shots interspersed between that she deleted as she went along. 
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t have an eye for this kind of thing, I&rsquo;ll admit, but some of those photos are... something, I&rsquo;ll give you that.&rdquo; </span> Shiragiku patted her companion&rsquo;s head. <span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;I have to say, you&rsquo;ll need to do more than just take photos in the upcoming battle, though.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; </span> Derse-chan replied, a little cross at Shiragiku for thinking she had to be reminded of such an obvious matter.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;I was only saying...&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
The carriage stopped at another station. A few more evacuees streamed in through the doors, most of whom had to stand. A young-looking carapacian, accompanied by what seemed to be his mother<sup><a id='footnote-anchor-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a></sup>, stands in front of the strange-looking pair of anime girls before his &ldquo;mother&rdquo; calls him away, having found two seats at the end of the carriage.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;Kurante?&rdquo; </span> Shiragiku says, gripping Derse-chan&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; </span> Derse-chan replies.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;We might not be able to stick together for this next encounter.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; </span> 
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;We may have to split up to cover more ground.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #8000ff'> &ldquo;I... I see. I&rsquo;ll try my best to keep up. It&rsquo;s not like I need your help, anyway.&rdquo; </span> 
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;Alright, alright. Glad to see you&rsquo;re gaining confidence.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
It was at this point that the carriage reached the surface, and the sight of Skaia above<sup><a id='footnote-anchor-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a></sup> them was visible through the window behind the duo. The doors on the other side whirred, and slowly opened; evacuees rushed for the doors, wanting to get off the planet as soon as possible, while Shiragiku and Derse-chan merely waited for the rest of the passengers to get off, the two of them standing at the very back of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
<span style='color: #60a0a0'> &ldquo;Are you ready to run? Eric and the rest are waiting for us, and we&rsquo;ve got a kilometer or so to go in ten minutes.&rdquo; </span><br/><br/><div class='footnoteblock'><a id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-anchor-1'>[1]</a> Of course, carapacians don&rsquo;t really have <em>parents</em> biologically, merely other game constructs that they are initialized as related to. But that&rsquo;s besides the point, and nonetheless they are effectively equivalent for all intents and purposes besides pedantry.<br/><a id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-anchor-2'>[2]</a> Perhaps <em>above</em> may not be the right word, but I&rsquo;ve never been to any planet&rsquo;s moon.</div><br/>
